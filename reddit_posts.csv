Also, Efficiency Mode is something the application itself takes advantage of. Chrome is putting itself into Efficiency Mode.

The antivirus updates normally happen in the background because they don't require reboots. The ones Windows normally ""checks for"" is the monthly cumulatives which do require reboots.

Windows automatically checks for updates once every 22 hours. It isn’t constantly checking.

Multiple definition updates are released daily. You don’t need to be on *the* latest one, just one from the last day. Chances are, if you manually check for updates, you’ll probably get a definition update because you *will* get the latest-available one.
I can't say that I've found this to be true but I've got to wonder why it bothers you. The whole point of automating updates is so that you can forget about it.
I have another computer running W10 and it doesn't behave like this. It just does all updates in the background.

1m4sq58,CSAgent BSoD global outage marks 1 year,"It's been a year since CrowdStrike pushed a broken update to one of its drivers within its flagship Falcon EDR, rendering millions of Windows machines around the world unbootable. As became known later, CSAgent.sys contains a kind of virtual machine and accepts packets with bytecode from the EDR's user-mode service to execute specific instructions in kernel mode. These bytecode apps should have passed all necessary quality tests, but something went wrong and CSAgent, a driver with the highest boot priority, received broken bytecode, the interpretation of which led to catastrophic consequences.

CrowdStrike was blamed for shaking the entire anti-malware industry, as Microsoft was forced to push its initiative to displace AVers from kernel mode. In March, MS announced a new Windows 11 boot mode called Quick Machine Recovery (QMR). It's based on Windows Recovery Environment (RE) and, after entering in this mode, it connects to the network and waits for recovery instructions.

Open Settings, go to System, and click on Advanced system settings, Click on the Hardware Tab up top, and then Device Installation Settings, and click on the No (Your device might not work as expected).

  
This should stop driver updates, may need to restart for it to work.
If you ever find yourself having to take ownership of files/directories, that's a sign that you're doing something wrong :)

In general, the best approach for dealing with unwanted drivers from Windows Update is to go into device manager, find the associated device, and select Roll Back driver. When you do this, Windows will no longer attempt to install that same driver version on that same device.

&nbsp;

For the ""SoftwareComponent"" devices, they'll be under the Software components node in device manager. Pretty sure that the MEDIA device would be in a Multimedia node in device manager (but possibly Sound, video & game controllers).

For the Extension driver though, the above guidance isn't going to work. AFAIK, there's no way to roll back this driver because it's installed on basically the same device as the ""main"" audio driver.

&nbsp;

If you want to share the sections of c:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log associated with the install of these drivers, I can take a look and try to figure out what that extension driver is actually doing/installing and hopefully tell you how you can undo it.

&nbsp;

For the Alienware things, IIRC they won't get installed if you remove the Alienware/Dell app.

&nbsp;

For the other audio things, my expectation would be that you could change/disable whatever extra functionality these packages are installing. Try looking for a Realtek/Nahimic app on your PC, or drill into the Sound Settings -> Advanced options.
Thank you!! I had forgotten about that setting after reinstalling windows a while back!

task scheduler has various triggers, not just time based.
Considering your rgbs need the app to start for them to work correctly, wouldn’t they just turn off again once it’s closed?
You can check this out and see if it can do what you need.

I don't believe you can use a ""work or school"" MS account to sign into Windows unless the device is corporate-owned. Just create a new local account by clicking the ""I don't have this person's sign-in info"" link when you add a new user.

Try Q-Dir for a multi folder explorer.
That's because it's based on WinUI 3 apps something, like the modern apps so any customization that you used to use won't work, like I use Scroll Navigator for just having the accelerated scrolling when you scroll through a long list of files in a folder, all these won't work with anything that's made on WinUI 3.

The way passwordless works is by connecting your account to a physical token. It can be something like a YubiKey or (what I personally use) the Microsoft Authenticator app on your phone (lower chance of losing your phone vs a YubiKey).

Windows Hello with a PIN is also a FIDO2 ""token"" that allows access to a MS passwordless account.

Since you have only 1 slot and 2 drives your options are either use another PC, or buy and external USB enclosure for your old SSD that way you can also use it as an external device.
External usb to m.2 enclosure. 
Acronis to clone 512 drive to 1tb drive that's plugged into the external enclosure.
Samsung SSD including NVME can use the Disc Magician cloning for free. https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/

You can clone a smaller drive to a large one with an usb enclosure for NVME then swap it. Windows will be already activated as the digital license is stored on the motherboard and not drive. 

Samsung is the only SSD drive I know that gives free cloning software.
You could use a USB 3.0 to 2.5-inch SATA Adapter cord. Then you can use software like Disk Genius or the SSD brand cloning software.
Hardware cloning is what I do, if I want to increase my storage capacity but also clone everything from one SSD to another.

1m3xx97,Why is A Windows Hello PIN Considered More Secure,"...than a password, when the normal password can always still be used anyways?

This is a very specific question. I know about all the common benefits of Windows Hello – like device dependency, tpm backed security and hammering protection, etc.

My question is specifically the following: How is this considered an increase in security, when **at all time, the normal password we have been trying to replace can be used to authenticate any action anyways**?

I see two possible explanations:
1. I don't know about some config option that disables the use of the normal password for authentication
2. since the user does not usually need to enter the normal password, they are less likely to leak it somehow, be it through writing it down somehwere or phishing, etc.

There is probably a difference in argumentation depending on if we are talking about home users or enterprise users. Because home users are initially expected to log in with their Microsoft account which is not a local password and ideally is protected by mfA. While enterprise users are expected to sign in with an AD un/pw, which can also be secured with mfA.

The primary purpose is in relation to your Microsoft Account. Normally you would have to use your Microsoft Account password when signing in, the PIN separates the two creating a ""password"" that only works on the local machine and nowhere else.

Microsoft allows users to completely eliminate the Password for their MS account.
What people are not clearly saying here is that passwords can be used to authenticate to a remote computer over a network. PINs can only be used locally. You can't connect to a network share with a PIN for example.
The PIN only unlocks a computer, not an account, and as such, it's phish resistant.

Windows Hello is a FIDO2 credential hardware-bound to the TPM of the computer.  It's like a built-in YubiKey.  The PIN, together with the TPM, unlocks the credential.

Windows Hello is so seamlessly integrated into Windows that most people have no idea they are using a FIDO2 Passkey.

It's also somewhat like a Passcode on iPhone.

post: Hi all,

Laptop Specs: Purchased in 2016 from PCSpecialist uk

Optimus Series: 17.3"" Matte Full HD IPS LED Widescreen (1920x1080)

Intel® Core™ i5 Quad Core Processor 6440HQ (2.6GHz, 3.5GHz Turbo)

16GB HyperX IMPACT 1600MHz SODIMM DDR3 (2 x 8GB)

NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 965M - 2.0GB DDR5 Video RAM - DirectX® 12

500GB WD BLACK 2.5"" WD5000LPLX, SATA 6 Gb/s, 32MB CACHE (7200 rpm)  -> This will be replaced with a 512GB/1TB SSD

I have already serviced the laptop including cleaning inside and a new thermal paste.

Main Usage: I will be using this for my Cyber Security courses and related software.

No Gaming and Graphics Editing.

Should I install Windows 10/11 or a Lightweight Linux distro? What are your recommendations.

Thanks in advance

comments: Don't hate me , but honestly , its linux , or windows 10 if you want to stay on windows 
This PC does not meet the requirements for Windows 11, however it does for Windows 10.
Is the Rufus method prohibited by rules or...? Because right now 24H2 W11 would run on the hardware, albeit unsupported
why not try chromeos. Just convert your laptop into a chromebook.  (depending on the software you are going to use)
Windows 10 is great and will work very well on this machine, especially with an ssd
If you use a Microsoft account, it seems that Microsoft will support Windows 10 for another year and a half or so, possibly longer with a paid extension.


Alternatively, if you can get by with the cloud versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe apps, or are comfortable with using open source alternatives, I might consider the Aurora or Bluefin spins on Fedora Linux.


These are ""atomic"" desktops designed with stability in mind, and Fedora in general has a reputation for being more stable than certain other popular Linux distros.


However, Nvidia GPUs and laptops with hybrid GPUs are a known pain point for Linux. You might have to try this to see if it works well for this hardware.
Win 10 will run great on it.


You can try Linux, but that will mean going down a rabbit hole.
Actually it has enough juice for W11. You can use Rufus Tool to make W11 installable for you.
Linux mint
Your laptop doesn't support the official hardware requirements to install Windows 11. You could bypass the specs check and install it anyways but hardware incompatibilities that might appear with future Windows updates (even security patches) might not be fixed because they won't be officially necessary. However at this moment most of bypassed installations work just fine if they meet the performance requirements.

If you're studying Cybersecurity then you'll realize that there's no point installing a nearly deprecated OS like Windows 10.

comments: Well, at minimum they should fix the taskbar auto-hide animation. 


I started using auto-hide recently after purchasing an OLED gaming display. 


Before I discovered this Windhawk mod, I had to disable animations system-wide due to how janky it was.


I'm usually pretty forgiving about Windows' many UI quirks, but this one is egregiously bad. 


I also rarely endorse shell hacks, but Windhawk has proven to be a solid, relatively safe option.
This is more or less my setup. The only I missed was ""auto-hide speed"".
What is the browser you're opening called?
No, At least I need an option to see the system tray icons and time at all time. I don't need to see my open apps all the time.
Nope
No, leave the task bar on left. Who wants their icons keep moving around?
How'd you get that maximize-minimize animation?

E: nvm I realized that it's already built-in to Windows lol
I thought you used RoundedTB
nahh, i dont care for docks

If you had an option enabled that only allows you to log in using Windows Hello (PIN, Fingerprint or Face), turning that option off allows you to use your password to log in.
Are you using a Raid configuration? If so it depends which type but swapping a drive out could wipe the drives you left in.

You device doesn't go slow because there's an entry of Camera app in Graphics Settings. Better check what apps you installed that can slow down your system.
Camera app doesn't do anything to make your PC perform bad.

The Reset button turns into a Remove button once it has been clicked. Untuitive design.

And that only happens for applications you add to the list manually. The ones that are automatically added cannot be removed.

The reason your computer is slow is likely the 8GB of RAM tbh. You can use Chris Titus' debloater if you want and it will actually lower the amount of RAM used slightly and some CPU, but it won't matter that much. RAM upgrade is your best option. 

Make sure to turn off anything you don't need from startup as well.

1m3b0ue,Copying System Image from One Windows 11 Home Computer to Another,"Did I just get real lucky? Or am I real smart? Or, alternately, am I living in a fool's paradise?

Here's the story. I have an Asus VivoBook Windows 11 Home v. 24H2 computer. It's got an Intel graphics card and an Intel i5-1035G1 CPU @ 1.00GHZ. It has 12 gigs of RAM, and is a 64-bit operating system.

It's got this intermittent problem which NO ONE has been able to solve where, for some reason, half of the screen, usually the lower half, starts displaying everything with a tasteful pink or green shade. The first time it happened, Geek Squad mis-diagnosed it as a display screen failure and charged me $400 for a replacement. The problem didn't come back until after the required 30 days, so they refused to refund the $400. They then told me that it was probably a problem with the motherboard or the graphics card and that it would cost me more to repair than simply to get a cheap new computer (this is not my primary computer, so I could skimp).

So I decided to try taking the System Image that I'd created for that computer and restoring it to a new computer. I asked Best Buy what was their cheapest open box Asus VivoBook computer. They had one available for $600 and I bought it.

It's a Windows 11 Home v. 24H2 computer. It's got an AMD Radeon graphics card and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor. It has 16 gigs of RAM and is a 64-bit operating system.

Years ago, I started using the Windows Backup & Restore System Image process. The first time I ever run it on a brand new computer I also always say ""Yes"" to the option of creating a repair disc. Whenever I've used one of those System Images to restore a busted computer, I've always booted from the repair disc first and then restored the image, and it's always been successful for me. I've used it half a dozen times to fix various laptops along the way, but always on the SAME laptop. This was the first time I was going to try dragging a System Image to a different laptop.

So I followed the same procedure here: I took the Windows repair disc that I'd made on the old Asus and booted my new Asus with it. I then directed my new Asus to do a System Image restore, using the System Image I'd made on the old Asus.

And it worked! Almost flawlessly! There were only two glitches. The first time I booted up the new Asus after completing the restore, I got the message that my computer PIN was messed up and I had to create a new one, so I did.

The second glitch was a bit more challenging. When the new Asus booted up after the restore, it was able to see my personal network and the other computers on the network. But my other computers couldn't see the new Asus. I did a bunch of gyrations that not only didn't fix the problem but made it worse inasmuch as the new Asus stopped seeing the other computers on the network!

I rebooted all computers to give the network a fresh start; no dice. The other computers still couldn't see the new Asus and the new Asus still couldn't see the other computers.

So then I had what I believe may have been a rather ingenious idea. I decided to try to cast the computers to each other, thinking that might wake up the network.

IT DID!!! All computers are now seeing each other in Windows Explorer, and I'm good to go.

I've been running the new Asus now for about three hours with no problems. One thing that did occur to me is that one element that might have helped smooth my path was that repair disc. A lot of the online comments about this procedure focused on problems with drivers. I'm thinking it's possible that that repair disc may have acted as a sort of roto-rooter, going through my computer and conforming my drivers to the old computer. Or perhaps I'm all wet about that.

So here's my question: Am I just incredibly lucky? Theoretically should this NOT have worked? Or am I incredibly smart, inasmuch as I figured out how to do something that's not recommended and yet I made it work?

Or am I living in a fool's paradise? Will I shortly start to experience problems in the coming days, weeks and months?

Oh, and by the way, the old Asus is suddenly displaying properly again, without the tasteful pink or green shade. I normally run it on AC but I'm running it on battery at the moment; related? Ironic............................","["">Did I just get real lucky?\xa0\n\n\nNo. An existing Windows 10/11 system image can be moved to another computer, even ones with different processors and motherboards, and Windows will detect the changed hardware and reconfigure itself automatically.

The first time it happened, Geek Squad mis-diagnosed it as a display screen failure and charged me $400 for a replacement. The problem didn't come back until after the required 30 days, so they refused to refund the $400. They then told me that it was probably a problem with the motherboard or the graphics card and that it would cost me more to repair than simply to get a cheap new computer (this is not my primary computer, so I could skimp). So I decided to try taking the System Image that I'd created for that computer and restoring it to a new computer. I asked Best Buy what was their cheapest open box Asus VivoBook computer. They had one available for $600 and I bought it. It's a Windows 11 Home v. 24H2 computer. It's got an AMD Radeon graphics card and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor. It has 16 gigs of RAM and is a 64-bit operating system. Years ago, I started using the Windows Backup & Restore System Image process. The first time I ever run it on a brand new computer I also always say 'Yes' to the option of creating a repair disc. Whenever I've used one of those System Images to restore a busted computer, I've always booted from the repair disc first and then restored the image, and it's always been successful for me. I've used it half a dozen times to fix various laptops along the way, but always on the SAME laptop. This was the first time I was going to try dragging a System Image to a different laptop. So I followed the same procedure here: I took the Windows repair disc that I'd made on the old Asus and booted my new Asus with it. I then directed my new Asus to do a System Image restore, using the System Image I'd made on the old Asus. And it worked! Almost flawlessly! There were only two glitches. The first time I booted up the new Asus after completing the restore, I got the message that my computer PIN was messed up and I had to create a new one, so I did. The second glitch was a bit more challenging. When the new Asus booted up after the restore, it was able to see my personal network and the other computers on the network. But my other computers couldn't see the new Asus. I did a bunch of gyrations that not only didn't fix the problem but made it worse inasmuch as the new Asus stopped seeing the other computers on the network! I rebooted all computers to give the network a fresh start; no dice. The other computers still couldn't see the new Asus and the new Asus still couldn't see the other computers. So then I had what I believe may have been a rather ingenious idea. I decided to try to cast the computers to each other, thinking that might wake up the network. IT DID!!! All computers are now seeing each other in Windows Explorer, and I'm good to go. I've been running the new Asus now for about three hours with no problems. One thing that did occur to me is that one element that might have helped smooth my path was that repair disc. A lot of the online comments about this procedure focused on problems with drivers. I'm thinking it's possible that that repair disc may have acted as a sort of roto-rooter, going through my computer and conforming my drivers to the old computer. Or perhaps I'm all wet about that. So here's my question: Am I just incredibly lucky? Theoretically should this NOT have worked? Or am I incredibly smart, inasmuch as I figured out how to do something that's not recommended and yet I made it work? Or am I living in a fool's paradise? Will I shortly start to experience problems in the coming days, weeks and months? Oh, and by the way, the old Asus is suddenly displaying properly again, without the tasteful pink or green shade. I normally run it on AC but I'm running it on battery at the moment; related?

If anything, it would be Proton that would make them sweat - Valve made it open source which means you have practically just as good gaming support on ANY Linux distribution (I'm writing this from my Garuda Linux with Ghost of Tsushima on the second monitor).

""Freeing up RAM"" is not needed. As in: Windows does a great job of that already.

But that comes at a cost of there being a bunch of those legacy systems clogging everything down.
Now why would they do a silly thing like that? You should boot up Candy Crush and stop thinking for yourself 
windows actually performs fine on gaming PCs. if you look at benchmarks between linux on windows on desktop, both are either on par or windows is usually ahead.

handhelds are unique and need optimizations because a) the windows UI doesn't work with a controller, and b) the handheld situation with shared memory means unloading the desktop does free up memory for graphics. not an issue with desktop PCs that have dedicated video memory.

and lastly, c) windows struggled with battery life on handhelds, so I assume microsoft is working on making the low-power modes on handhelds consume less power. this is not something you'd typically want on a desktop PC.

if you want to experience the ""optimization"" of linux on your PC, you can actually just install linux and try it for yourself right now - I recommend bazzite or linux mint because both are easy to install. just don't be surprised if it match the online hype
Windows 11 as PC OS is already optimized, I'm one who never turn my desktop off with all of my works open, when it's time for me to play I just minimized all and play, even when my RAM usage at 70-80% of my 32gb.

Wait. The Windows 10 start menu is now classic? Gosh back in my day the classic start menu was the one found in Windows 95 to Windows 2000.
Why choose? Add it as a second option via the installation screen and settings.
You cannot fathom how small of a % 2000 users is to Microsoft.

Not saying I don't agree, but there is 100s if not 1000s of things more important than the old start menu.

But I won't hold my breathe they'll do either...
ExplorerPatcher adds back the 10 Start Menu. Instead of a meaningless Reddit post, try using that.
Yea win11 gui become backwards proving.
I'd rather have the Windows 7 Start Menu back
Nah I like 11 better.

1. Microsoft Edge uninstall option
2. Recall export feature
3. Default browser settings
4. Search engine control
How can I enable these options outside of Europe? I remember it was just editing a JSON file... Is that still the case?
Shiiiit, how many ads and pop-ups can a site have?
Being able to uninstall edge felt so good.
Uninstalling Edge was the first time I smiled while using Windows 11.
One thing I kinda miss from the old Edge ( nonChromium ) was the ability to ***ADD*** completely custom Search Providers like the Search Function of say the Amazon or Pinterest Sites allowing you to search for results on those sites from within the Browser Search Bar itself.

That was kinda neat 🤔
This is how Windows should be by default because it's a paid product. It's unfortunate that Microsoft has reduced all of its software to nagware. I'm glad it's a simple process to enable DMA outside of the EU and reap the benefits.
the search engine thing is neat but so far no one has made support for it(if im not wrong)
Uninstalling Edge felt like finally getting rid of that one annoying app you never use. It's liberating to have the choice.

>Is Edge better than Chrome?


Edge has been better than Chrome all along. 
While this is unrelated, Firefox might be your best bet with uBlock origin.  

Edit: msedge (autocorrect) should support manifest v2 for a little while longer, so it should be better.  You can still install the impacted ad blockers but uBlock origin lite supports manifest v3 (but I still recommend finding a permanent solution as there was no plan that could be found in the retirement of it)
Pie adblock.
I have switched to Edge since 2023. AdGuard works good on Edge on MacOS (browser extension) and Windows (independent software), and on ChromeOS as an extension.
For Chrome, for now, use this to keep it using the Manifest V2 feature (the thing that's being deprecated and breaking a lot of extensions).

Work PC was force upgrade to Win 11 this week (Not loving it yet) there is an icon to switch from Desktop 1 to Desktop 2. 

Anyone using that feature? And what do you use it for?

comments: The icon is useless since you can access it with Win+Tab, but it's basically Virtual Desktops.  
[Here's real use example](https://streamable.com/dxkdqb), great if you don't have multiple monitors. KB shortcut for switching is Ctrl+Win+Left/Right arrow.
 Virtual desktops are great for segmenting stuff. I can have my regular day-to-day desktop, one for tagging and managing some new music, one for researching something, another for managing my servers. All separate from each other with window placement and what's visible. The best way to think about it is having tabs (or tab groups) for your desktop.
Windows 10 also had this feature but Windows 11 made it more obvious.
It's great. Non-work stuff on one desktop, work stuff on another desktop where I don't have to see it when I'm not working. Better work/life separation

The only downside for me is the annoying little label that pops up at the bottom of the screen when you switch between them. I really do not need it and if you have the taskbar set to auto-hide (as I do), and you bring the taskbar up, it stops you being able to interact with the area around the label until it disappears. Very annoying
Every day, can not live without it both private as work. 

\*Usecase: Mutiple clients:\*

So for work i used to work for 4-16 different clients at the same time (not active but i need to switch)

so i created 16 ""Desktops-clientname"" each with:  
\- Screen 1: Documentation of the client + customers CMS  
\- Screen 2: A remote desktop connection to the customers enviroment  
\- Screen 3: a empty ""Workspace"" with a browser used for googing and such.

Now i would get a call, switch to the correct desktop (\~2 seconds work) and everything is ready to use.

My coworksers needed to find the correct tab, (re)log into the correct servers and cleanup. 

saved a lot of time in the day. but mostly was a lot more calm to work with then my co-workers system of getting a call stressing to find the correct browser page, looking up the server and trying to connect etc. 

\*Use case : Organizing work\*

Currently i dont work with different clients anymore but i still have 10 desktops.   
Desktop 1 <== work stuff is here  
Desktop 2 <== work stuff is here, but empty only if i need to switch to a clean desk for a short time.  
Desktop 3 <== work stuff is here, but empty dedicated to share screen on teams with coworkers.  
Private <= private stuff here   
Remote session - NameRemoteServer  
Remote session - NameRemoteServer  
Remote session - NameRemoteServer  
Remote session - NameRemoteServer

I have Teams and Outlook set to ""Show on all desktops""
I sometimes use it to have a separate focus. Like the first one will be my main work, the second one I might use to have a cleaner space for a bit. You can leave everything open in the main one and just focus on a few things in the second. Or I might do personal things at lunch so I am separate from my work. Or I'll have a browser on the second one open with music on it, so it's not open with my work browser. Yes, you can have a separate browser or new browser window or new tab on your first desktop. But sometimes it's helpful to have a completely separate area.
I use it when I go into meetings and can't be bothered hiding my open apps
Mostly use it at work, desktop 1 is my 'general' desktop, but I use the 2nd desktop (or sometimes even a 3rd) to focus on a specific job, e.g. software development, document reviewing, etc.
It's great for multitasking specifically task separation and multiple window management. If you're someone who only does one thing at a time, then this feature might not offer much value to you.
